<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This creamy pork tenderloin medallions recipe is so simple yet elegant! It's ultra comforting, quick to make, and has
    the most delicious cream sauce.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 Pound Pork Tenderloin</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
    <li>Flour for Dredging</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Butter</li>
    <li>2 Cloves Garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 Tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup Chicken Stock or White Wine</li>
    <li>1/4 Tsp Italian Seasoning</li>
    <li>1 Cup Heavy Cream</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbsp Fresh Parsley</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Trim off excess fat and slice the pork tenderloin into about 1" thick pieces (rounds).</li>
    <li>Season the pork with salt & pepper and coat each piece in flour.</li>
    <li>Add the oil and butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the pork (you may need to do
        this in batches) and cook for about 3 minutes/side or until they're lightly golden. Take the pan off the heat
        and remove the pork from the pan.</li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic, Dijon mustard, chicken broth, Herbes de Provence, and then return the pan to the heat.
        Scrape up any brown bits. Let the sauce cook for about a minute.</li>
    <li>Stir in the cream and let it bubble for about 2 minutes. Add the pork back in and cook for 5 minutes (you may
        need to turn the heat down a bit) until the pork is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to your liking.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle the fresh parsley over top and season with extra salt & pepper if needed.</li>
</ol>
